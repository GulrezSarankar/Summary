# Summary
A full-stack Summary Generator App built with React, Flask, and MySQL that allows users to securely register, log in, and generate abstractive or extractive summaries using the T5 model. Summaries are saved with a unique ID and sent to the user’s email, with a clean, responsive, animated UI.
